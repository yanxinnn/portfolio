  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Problem</div>Balancing the demands of academia, employment, meetings, assignments, and deadlines presents a significant challenge for numerous high school and college students. Research consistently shows that individuals in this age bracket endure heightened stress levels as they navigate multiple responsibilities. In this struggle to effectively manage their time and priorities, students often find themselves overwhelmed, leading to increased stress levels that can negatively impact their mental well-being and academic performance.<br><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Goal</div><ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'><li>Help students keep track of their school, work, and personal responsibilities in a stress-free way.</li></ul><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Process</div>To create Float-it Notes, I:\

  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Result</div>I prototyped a Chrome extension that helps users stay afloat in the hecticity of their everyday by providing them with a sanctuary in their New Tab page where they can stay organized, motivated, and sane, with light-hearted aesthetics, daily inspirational quotes, and built-in task management tools.\
  <br><br>Users store their tasks as bottles that get added onto their New Tab page's waterscape and can view/update their tasks throughout the day. <br><br>Features include:<br>\

  <li>A time/date display</li><li>Hand-drawn images and animations</li><li>Daily inspirational quotes</li></ul><br>\
  This is a passion project that I plan to release onto the Chrome Web Store and is for those who need a planner and appreciate a bit of playfulness throughout their daily Chrome browsing experience!",

  "I began this project by conducting interviews with 8 students aged 14-25 to get a better understanding of my targeted demographic‚Äôs goals and pain points when it comes to task management.\
  <br><br>My initial user research goals were to find out:\
  <ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'>\
  <li>General online habits</li><li>Current/past usage of planners if any (physical and/or digital)</li><li>Favorite aspects of current solution</li><li>Parts of their current solution that don‚Äôt meet their needs</li></ul><br>\
  These are the user research questions that I asked participants (ages 16-23) during one-on-one interviews conducted on Zoom and Discord.",

  "The insights from the research findings revealed:<br>\
  <ol class='descriptionsNoPadding'>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Digital planner usage was the majority.</span>The majority of students reported using digital planners, with popular choices including Google Calendar, the Notes app, and Trello.</li><br>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Main benefits and pain points of digital planners.</span>Students mostly valued the accessibility, ease of organization, and reminder features of digital planners. However, their main pain points included the lack of task customization and detailing, an overwhelming amount of unused tools, and lack of sorting/grouping options for subjects.<br><br>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Main benefits and pain points of physical planners.</span>Students who preferred physical planners mostly valued the flexibility they offered in adding creative non-text elements and customizing  formatting to their liking. Their main pain points included difficulties in organization, editing/reformatting, and lack of accessibility.</li></ol>",

  "Here are some of the competitors I researched that take over the New Tab page, most of which were productivity extensions. I took note of each of their taglines, audiences, purposes, features, scopes, and visual styles.<br><br>\
  From this, I was able to draw similarities between the offerings of current solutions and see where I can bridge the gap in where they lacked in meeting the pain points of users I discovered from my research.",

  "Based on my findings from competitor analysis and user research, I identified key features that users value in planner/task manager extension. These insights guided the development of Float-it Notes, ensuring that it fulfilled user needs as a digital planner while also incorporating unique features that differentiate it from competitors.<br><br>\
  I utilized the MoSCoW method to prioritize certain features to be completed in time for my Undergrad Senior Capstone Project Gallery Exhibition but plan to implement more features before releasing my extension onto the Chrome App Store!",

  "Room is a mobile app designed for young adults living in cities find the perfect room and roommate. It offers a personalized experience by matching users with potential roommates based on their preferences, assisting in locating suitable living spaces, and facilitating a smooth transition into independent living with their new roommates. Room aims to make the process of finding the ideal room and roommate easy, safe, and enjoyable.<br><br>\
  As a UX Designer on a team of 3 designers, I played a pivotal role in shaping the app's user experience. My responsibilities included conducting competitive analysis, gathering insights through user surveys and interviews, leading the development of personas and journey maps, and crafting wireframes that effectively incorporated research findings to enhance the mobile experience.<br><br>\

  <div class='projectCards'><div class='projectCardsTitle'>Technologies</div>Figma, Google Forms</div></div><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Problem</div>Finding an ideal roommate in cities is a significant challenge for many young adults. As they transition to independent living, high living costs often necessitate splitting rent with roommates. Traditional methods of finding roommates, such as word-of-mouth, social media groups, or generic listing platforms, often fall short in addressing the specific needs and preferences of this tech-savvy, socially conscious generation. This results in prolonged search times, increased stress, and a higher likelihood of mismatched living situations, which can lead to conflicts and instability in their daily lives.<br><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Goal</div><ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'><li>Make it easy and safe for young adults to find the ideal roommate in cities.</li></ul><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Process</div>For Room, I collaborated with my teammates and:\
  <ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'><li>Analyzed competitors in the current market of roommate matching apps.</li><li>Conducted surveys amongst our targeted demographic to learn the objectives and pain points of their roommate/room experiences.</li><li>Generated personas and journey maps from the collected user research data.</li><li>Constructed user flows for both new and returning users with different objectives.</li><li>Created a strategy document outlining product objectives, market opportunities, and product visions.</li><li>Designed low/mid fidelity wireframes prototyping the sign-in/sign-up process, user profile customizations, roommate matching system and apartment listings search system.</li></ul><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Result</div>My teammates and I designed a prototype for Room, a mobile dedicated to helping young adults find the perfect roommate, locate a suitable place to live, and smoothly transition into their new independent life with their roommates.<br><br>",

  "My teammates and I conducted a competitive analysis on 6 popular room and/or roommate finder apps and other apps with similar functionalities, categorizing them by competitor type, priorities, key features, region accessibility, and KPIs.<br><br>From this research, we identified several opportunities to enhance Room with features that have proven beneficial in similar apps:\
  <ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Innovative matching.</span>\
  Combine Tinder's swiping feature with Roomi's background checks and in-depth questionnaires to ensure mutual safety and increase user excitement for sharing commonalities with their matches.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Advanced search filters.</span>\
  Offer a wide range of search parameters to refine roommate and room searches, ensuring relevance to user preferences.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Global accessibility.</span>\
  Ensure app availability in multiple languages worldwide, promoting inclusivity and user convenience across regions.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Diverse communication methods.</span>\
  Provide text, call, and video call options for online interaction so users can get to know each other online before meeting in person.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Detailed listings.</span>\
  Display landlords' profiles and details on listings for easy access, increasing trust and transparency.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Ratings and testimonials.</span>\
  Include previous renter feedback for landlords and properties to build trust and credibility.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Communal living resources.</span>\
  Offer additional resources (such as tips on bill management, chore division, and shared groceries) to support smooth transitions harmonious cohabitation.</li></ul>",

  "The goal of our user research was to understand the concerns and desires 18-25 year olds have in regards to the roommate/room  searching process. Participants were asked about their past or current rooming experiences, their experience with NYU's roommate matching system (if applicable), their current solutions to finding a roommate or room, and their level of comfort in using quick digital transaction to pay for rent.<br><br>The surveys were carried out through anonymous Google Forms which were sent out to the NYU community, friends, and friends of friends.",

  "Our research of 21 participants, with an age range of 18-25, revealed these key insights:\
  <ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Majority preferred living with one roommate.</span>\
  Reasons given were quieter living conditions, easier communication, and overall comfort. Understanding this preference helped us determine how much customization was needed for the app‚Äôs group interactions and management features.</li>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>Personality quizzes were generally successful.</span>\
  Experiences of roommate matches by college roommate matching systems were generally positive. However, many expressed a desire for a more personalized process with more options for selecting roommates and the ability to connect with potential roommates beforehand. This validated our plan to use personality quizzes for roommate matching, while also helping us gauge the depth of detail needed. Additionally, it enforced the importance of the app offering diverse communication methods.</liv>\
  <li><span class='descriptionsHighlight'>The main considerations when evaluating a potential roommate.</span>\
  Key factors for considering a potential roommate included their cleanliness, trustworthiness, safety, responsibility in paying bills, and potential personality or lifestyle clashes. Based on this information, we optimized Room's filtering system to ensure that users can search for roommates and rooms by the categories most important to them.</li></ul>",

  "From the user research, we were able to optimize Room's filtering system to make sure that users are able to search for roommates and rooms by the categories most important to them. It also gave us a clear picture of who our target demographic was, their situations, their motives, and their fears, informing the construction of our 2 personas, Naomi and Arjun.<br><br>While Naomi and Arjun are both searching for a roommate, their differences in age, occupation, personalities, likes/dislikes, and circumstances mean that their criteria for a roommate vary significantly. <br><br>\
  As we designed Room, we adopted the perspectives of Naomi and Arjun to ensure that the app experience was versatile and useful for a broad spectrum of users.",

  "I led the development of journey maps for Naomi and Arjun, portraying two scenarios demonstrating how users might use Room to find a roommate and fulfill their individual goals. Each of these experiences has its own highs and lows in terms of user satisfaction.<br><br>\
  These journey maps helped pinpoint pivotal moments where we could capitalize on positives emotions and take proactive measures to alleviate negative feelings throughout the user‚Äôs app experience. Additionally, KPI‚Äôs were established for each stage of the user journey for effective tracking and optimization.",

  "Then, to gain a more granular understanding of the user experience in accomplishing specific tasks, we utilized user flows to showcase 2 common scenarios: new users onboarding and returning users checking-in.<br><br>\
  These user flows show the different screens users visit and decisions they make as they complete their goals within the app. This ensures that each step of a user's session is efficient and purposeful.",

  "Lastly, here is the strategy document that compiles Room's product objectives, market opportunities, and product vision.",

  For this project, I:\
  <ul class='descriptionsNoPadding'><li>Researched exercise and mobile gaming statistics in the US.</li><li>Analyzed competitor fitness apps and their features.</li><li>Conducted 2 rounds of user research amongst gamers to learn target audience's core needs and workout habits (1st round) and to receive insight for how users interact with the mobile prototype (2nd round).</li><li>Generated user flows for different user experiences.</li><li>Created a style guide for the app's colors, typography, buttons, and branding.</li><li>Designed low and high-fidelity wireframes prototyping the sign-in/sign-up process for mobile and desktop, character creation, various game features (inventory, shop, skills, and Battle Tower system) and the workout experience for users.</li></ul><br>\
  <div class='projectSubtitles'>Result</div>I designed a working prototype for Inertia, a mobile fitness game that helps members of the gaming community and RPG fans transform their gaming passions into a healthier lifestyle.<br><br>\
  Inertia gives users a setting they are familiar and drawn to - RPG games - and motivates users to workout by recognizing their efforts with in-game rewards and progression. While the rewards of physical body changes from working out might take at least a few months to show, Inertia helps keep users excited for their next session by providing more immediate feedback every time they complete a run or workout.",

  "I started this project with background research on exercise and mobile gaming, primarily in the US, to gain an understanding of how my hybrid app can potentially bridge the gap between these two industries. <br><br>Further competitive analysis of various fitness apps showed how current solutions were addressing the problem of inactivity among US residents and the various features that made them successful/stand out, giving me ideas for features to incorporate into Inertia.",

  "My first round of user research's goal was to learn my target audience's core needs and workout habits. <br><br>I surveyed 16 participants, ages 15-21, that played at least 3 hours of games a week, and asked them questions concerning their gaming and exercise habits and preferences. These surveys were done through Google Forms for anonymity as some people may not be comfortable disclosing sensitive information such as how much they exercise, how long they spend playing games, etc.",

  "Main findings from the first round of user research included:\
  <ol class='descriptionsNoPadding'><li>Participants‚Äô reasons for playing games were for entertainment, escape, or socialization.</li><li>What participants found most appealing about RPGs were the storylines, the game completion/achievements, ability to play with friends, the sense of progression, and character creation and customization.</li><li>Most of participants that did work out either did light workouts a few times a week just to keep active and did not have workout equipment.</li><li>Participants' motivations for working out were for physical changes, more energy, self-esteem, sports-related, and mental health reasons.</li></ol><br>\
  This research was crucial in understanding the target audience and their needs and served as a guide for the brainstorming and subsequent designs of Inertia.",

  "I created multiple user-flows for different user motives, such as a user-flow for returning users logging on to complete a workout (using Workout) and a user-flow for returning users preparing character for the Battle Tower (using Shop, Skills Tree, Inventory, Battle Tower).",

  "The second round of user research was live 1-on-1 recorded interviews with participants on either Zoom or Discord testing for app navigation and usability.<br><br>During these 10-15 minute interviews, participants were provided with a link to a mobile prototype of Inertia. They were instructed to share their screen and vocalize their thoughts as they navigated through a series of tasks to complete within the app. I kept track of the time spent on each task and took note of any smooth interactions, unexpected issues, and observations/comments made by the users.",

  "From the second round of user research, I received valuable feedback that I incorporated into the refinement and improvement of Inertia's user experience. Since my users were all gamers interacting with Inertia for the first time, they were able to bring in their own knowledge and understanding of game mechanics they were familiar with. Their responses aided in enhancing Inertia as not only a fitness app, but also as a functional and enjoyable game.<br><br>Highlighted bullet points in the image indicate popular/repeated feedback from participants.",

  "Inertia's game portion is an RPG. Users play as a character of a class of their choosing (warrior, mage, priest, archer, or assassin) as they battle their way through floors of the virtual world‚Äôs dungeon, called the Battle Tower, either solo or with friends. The battle system is turn based, with each player/enemy character using their mana to cast an ability on their turn. The battle ends when all the characters of a side has no health left. <br><br>Players can make their characters stronger with equipment and skill points they gain from working out. They can sell/buy/customize their equipment in the Shop, level up their unique class skills/abilities in the Skills Tree, and change their equipment and character appearance in Inventory.",

  "The fitness portion of Inertia consists players completing runs or workouts for the chance to obtain better equipment and to gain skill points to aid them in their Battle Tower climb. <br><br>The first few floors of the Battle Tower can be defeated without grinding out runs and workouts to give users a taste of what the gameplay is like and hopefully, make them excited to exercise to continue advancing. The rewards from these workouts scales with the user's in-game progression. <br><br>To ensure that users are honestly working out, the app will require users to verify their exercises by either scanning QR codes on workout machines, using their phone's camera to track their movements, or linking to a heart rate monitor.",

  "Inertia's designs adhere to a style guide to ensure that the app's colors, typography, buttons, and branding are consistent throughout all screens and interactions for a cohesive and seamless user experience.",
