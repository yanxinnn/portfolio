# Overview

Pypeline is a SaaS enterprise application designed to empower data professionals, enabling them to optimize data processes, automate tasks, and drive efficiency in data acquisition and processing. This project aims to enhance the user experience in managing, cleaning, and transforming data through an intuitive, no-code platform.

### I was the sole designer on the founding team.

I joined the Pypeline team as a UX designer on a global team of over 20 professionals, including product managers, software developers, data scientists, and DevOps engineers. During my one and a half years in this role, I oversaw all aspects of the end-to-end UX design process, from inception to public launch, and ensuring the seamless delivery of a comprehensive and user-centric product.

# Problem

**Many financial institutions struggle to efficiently manage large volumes of data, facing inefficiencies and reliability issues with current solutions.**

<br />
For financial institutions handling massive volumes of transactions daily, seamless
access, processing, and integration of large datasets at scale is a “must-have”.
However, the current solutions utilized by data professionals often rely heavily
on Excel, manual processes, and a complex array of ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load)
tools, leading to complexity, inefficiency, and risks that jeopardize data reliability.
This presents a significant problem as it impedes operational efficiency, incurs
unnecessary costs and overhead, and limits data availability for informed decision-making.

# Goal

**Provide data professionals with transparency, enhanced accessibility, and control
in managing their data lifecycles.**

## Defining objectives with the product team

At the start of the project, I worked with product managers to shape the product vision, learn about our stakeholders and their objectives/pain points, and plan out an initial roadmap of core features and time estimates for Pypeline’s MVP release.

## Researching existing data lifecycle management solutions

I researched a handful of the top industry leading solutions for data lifecycle management and took note of their capabilities, targeted users, selling factor(s) that sets them apart from others in the field, and branding/UI. Some had free trial offerings that I signed up for to get a better sense of an end user’s experience.

<br />
This competitive analysis was useful in gaining insight into the landscape Pypeline
was entering, expectations of standard data management tools, and ideas for additional
features for Pypeline that would build or improve upon the successes and gaps of
existing solutions.

## Laying out product sitemap and user flows

To organize and account for all of Pypeline’s planned features, I created a sitemap detailing the application’s screens and functionalities available on each. Various user flows were made depicting the steps users with different goals would take during their app experience.

<br />
These artifacts helped ensure that certain features were available to users at relevant
times and served as a reference for creating the initial wireframes.

## Conducting regular user testing throughout design iterations

Throughout the designing of Pypeline, I regularly conducted user surveys, interviews, contextual inquiries, and A/B testing. Participants ranged from experienced client-facing team members to those with no or limited prior knowledge of data lifecycles. This allowed me to evaluate the navigability and ease of use of wireframes and prototypes, gathering feedback to improve Pypeline’s adoptability and usability for users of all levels of data management software familiarity. During meetings with stakeholders, I also used research findings to validate design decisions.

<br />
As Pypeline is marketed as a beginner friendly, “no-coding expertise required” application,
significant attention was dedicated to refining the drag-and-drop “sandbox” UI. This
is the workspace where users have access to over 50 configurable data operations
to transform their input data via draggable “nodes”. The sandbox offers users clear
visualization and flexibility in building and managing their data transformation
workflows.

<br />
User testing feedback helped improve the intuitiveness, discoverability, and necessity
of features. An example of these iterations is the UI of nodes in the sandbox:

<br />
Each node represents a step in the overall workflow.

<br />

<br />
Double clicking on a node opens up a modal that shows the details of that transformation
(form on the left) with a preview of the data after its been applied (data grid on
the right).

<br />
<ImageContainer
  images={["/images/pypeLine/pypeLineJoinModal.png"]}

<br />
Some nodes, like the “Join” node, offer multiple types of operations within it. The
“Join” node offers 4 types: Inner Join, Outer Join, Vertical Union, and Horizontal
Union. The desired operation type is selectable via the “Join Type” dropdown in the
modal.

<br />
The problem with the initial node UI was that it only showed the node name and record
count. For nodes offering multiple types of operations, users had to open up the
node modal to see the selected operation type. User testing and feedback revealed
that this information was frequently sought after, and the extra step required to
get it was a common point of friction.

<br />
While a roundabout solution was renaming the node name to include the operation type
(ex. "Join" → "Join - Vertical Union"), it was a tedious and repetitive action to
take for every node in the sandbox and resulted in long, bulky node names.

<br />
The new node designs address these issues by adding a designated section for the
operation type on the node’s sandbox UI, making the information much more accessible,
while allowing users to name nodes freely without needing to include the operation
type. This quality of life improvement was widely appreciated by test users and significantly
enhanced their experience.

</div>

<br />
Apart from the sandbox, a majority of Pypeline’s other screens consists of data tables.
These tables hold information and management tools related to various assets, such
as Pypelines (the data workflows created in the sandbox), Files, Schedules, and more.
The challenge with designing these table was ensuring that critical information was
scannable with appropriate actionable tasks readily available.

<br />
By collaborating closely with stakeholders and drawing insights from user feedback,
I was able to refine the data table designs so users could quickly locate important
metrics and actions while minimizing cognitive overload.

## Facilitating the design-to-development process

To maintain design-to-development consistency, I worked closely with the engineering team throughout the project. I held regular meetings with front-end developers to discuss design specifications, clarify requirements, and address any technical constraints. Detailed design documentation was provided, outlining all UI elements, interactions, and user flows.

<br />
During development, we encountered a significant problem with the implementation
of node modal forms. Pypeline offers over 50 data transformations, each requiring
a unique modal form with different layouts, fields, and sections. Initially, each
form was created separately without reusable templates or components. This led to
lengthy development times ranging from 2 to 6 weeks per node, depending on the volume
and complexity of data operations they included.

<br />
To solve this roadblock, I worked with both front-end and back-end developers to
design scalable components for forms and other interactive elements. Together, we
broke down the 50+ forms into 10 templates built with reusable components. I documented
this approach in detail on a Confluence page, ensuring clarity and ease of implementation.

### I collaborated with the engineering team to reduce the development time of node modals by approximately 80-90%.

This new methodology drastically improved development efficiency of node modals, reducing the time required for completion to only a few days to 1 week. This improvement helped us get back on track with deliverables and meet deadlines.

<br />
Additionally, I actively participated in front-end coding using JavaScript (React),
HTML, and CSS. This hands-on involvement allowed me to directly influence the implementation,
ensuring the final product stayed true to the design, sped up development, and helped
catch and fix bugs early.

<br />
My technical knowledge greatly enhanced my communication with developers, allowing
us to have more productive discussions and make informed decisions. This was a rewarding
and awesome learning experience and I take pride in my contributions to both the
design and development aspects of the project.

# Reflections and Learnings

Working on this project was an incredible experience that greatly contributed to my growth and development as a designer and developer. Here are my top 3 takeaways!

## 1. Taking ownership and fostering a UX design culture.

As the sole designer on the team, I developed my leadership abilities by taking ownership of the designs and
promoting inclusivity, collective ownership, and open communication within the team.

<br />
This involved:

- Educating and advocating for the adoption of best UX practices throughout
  the organization through presentations, one-on-one conversations, and clear design
  specifications and documentation.
- Promoting cross-functional team collaborations
  early in the design process to make sure needs of all stakeholders were accounted
  for.
- Ensuring regular communication and feedback sessions with cross-functional
  team members throughout the design process.

## 2. Creating and maintaining a design system.

My experience as the founding designer for this project provided me with invaluable insights into creating and managing
a consistent and scalable design system, along with an understanding of the challenges
and complexities involved.

<br />
Through hands-on experience and continuous learning, I learned to prioritize:

- Following best practices for design system management.
- Conducting regular audits and reviews to ensure design system’s consistency and effectiveness.
- Staying up to date on new tools and technologies to enhance efficiency in both design and development processes.

## 3. Adapting to evolving business requirements.

Throughout the project, one of the key challenges our team faced was adjusting to the dynamic nature of business
requirements. As the project progressed, we encountered multiple instances where
business priorities shifted or stakeholders introduced additional requirements that
required adjustments to the design direction and feature prioritization. This experience
highlighted the importance of effective team communication and setting clear objectives
and timelines at the start of each sprint, while also remaining flexible to changing
circumstances.
