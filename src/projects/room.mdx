# Overview

Room is a mobile app designed for young adults living in cities find the perfect room and roommate. It offers a personalized experience by matching users with potential roommates based on their preferences, assisting in locating suitable living spaces, and facilitating a smooth transition into independent living with their new roommates. Room aims to make the process of finding the ideal room and roommate easy, safe, and enjoyable.

### I worked in a team of 3 designers.

As a UX Designer within a team of 2 other designers, I played a pivotal role in shaping the app's user experience. My responsibilities included conducting competitive analysis, gathering insights through user surveys and interviews, leading the development of personas and journey maps, and crafting wireframes that effectively incorporated research findings to enhance the mobile experience.

# Problem

**Young adults living in cities often struggle to find compatible roommates, leading to significant time investment and negative impacts on their well-being.**

<br />
Finding an ideal roommate in cities is a significant challenge for many young adults.
As they transition to independent living, high living costs often necessitate splitting
rent with roommates. Traditional methods of finding roommates, such as word-of-mouth,
social media groups, or generic listing platforms, often fall short in addressing
the specific needs and preferences of this tech-savvy, socially conscious generation.
This results in prolonged search times, increased stress, and a higher likelihood
of mismatched living situations, which can lead to conflicts and instability in their
daily lives.

# Goal

**Make it easy and safe for young adults living in cities to find the ideal roommate.**

# Process

#### Researching roommate finder apps and other related apps

My teammates and I conducted a competitive analysis on 6 popular room and/or roommate finder apps and other apps with similar functionalities, categorizing them by competitor type, priorities, key features, region accessibility, and KPIs.

<br />
From this research, we identified several opportunities to enhance Room with features
that have proven beneficial in similar apps:

- **Innovative matching.** Combine Tinder's swiping feature with Roomi's background checks and detailed questionnaires for safer and more exciting matches.

- **Advanced search filters.** Offer a wide range of search parameters to refine roommate and room searches, ensuring relevance to user preferences.

- **Global accessibility.** Ensure app availability in multiple languages worldwide, promoting inclusivity and user convenience across regions.

- **Diverse communication methods.** Provide text, call, and video call options for online interaction so users can get to know each other online before meeting in person.

- **Detailed listings.** Display landlords' profiles and details on listings for easy access, increasing trust and transparency.

- **Ratings and testimonials.** Include previous renter feedback for landlords and properties to build trust and credibility.

- **Communal living resources.** Offer additional resources (such as tips on bill management, chore division, and shared groceries) to support smooth transitions harmonious cohabitation.

## Learning about rooming experiences from 18-25 year olds

Next, we conducted anonymous surveys using Google Forms, targeting 21 students aged 18-25 within the NYU community and extended networks. Our goal was to understand the concerns and desires young adults have during the roommate and room search process, enabling us to better cater to their specific needs with our solution.

<br />
Participants were asked about their:

- Past or current rooming experiences.
- Living and lifestyle preferences.
- Type of qualities preferred in a roommate.
- Experience with their college’s roommate matching system (if applicable).
- Current solution(s) to finding a roommate or room.

<br />
Our research revealed these key insights:

- **Majority preferred living with one roommate.** Reasons given were quieter living conditions, easier communication, and overall comfort. Understanding this preference helped us determine how much customization was needed for the app’s group interactions and management features.

- **Personality quizzes were generally successful.** Experiences of roommate matches by college roommate matching systems were generally positive. However, many expressed a desire for a more personalized process with more options for selecting roommates and the ability to connect with potential roommates beforehand. This validated our plan to use personality quizzes for roommate matching, while also helping us gauge the depth of detail needed. Additionally, it enforced the importance of the app offering diverse communication methods.

- **The main considerations when evaluating a potential roommate.** Key factors for considering a potential roommate included their cleanliness, trustworthiness, safety, responsibility in paying bills, and potential personality or lifestyle clashes. Based on this information, we optimized Room's filtering system to ensure that users can search for roommates and rooms by the categories most important to them.

<br />
## Creating personas for roommate seekers

To ensure that the app experience was versatile and useful for a broad spectrum of users, we created 2 personas, Naomi and Arjun, based on insights from our user research. This research provided a deep understanding of our target demographic’s, living situations, motives, and fears, which shaped the development of these personas.

<br />
While both Naomi and Arjun are searching for a roommate, their differences in age,
occupation, personalities, likes/dislikes, and circumstances mean that their criteria
for a roommate vary significantly.{" "}

<br />
By adopting the perspectives of Naomi and Arjun in our design process, we aimed to
make Room an app that meets the diverse needs of its users.

## Developing journey maps and user flows

I led the development of journey maps for Naomi and Arjun, portraying two scenarios demonstrating how users might use Room to find a roommate and fulfill their individual goals. Each of these experiences has its own highs and lows in terms of user satisfaction.

<br />
These journey maps helped pinpoint pivotal moments where we could capitalize on positives
emotions and take proactive measures to alleviate negative feelings throughout the
user’s app experience. Additionally, KPI’s were established for each stage of the
user journey for effective tracking and optimization.

<br />
Then, to gain a more granular understanding of the user experience in accomplishing
specific tasks, we utilized user flows to showcase these common scenarios:

<br />

- **New user onboarding.** New user creates an account, matches with a potential roommate,
  and sends them a message.

<br />

- **Returning user check-in.** Returning user browses through apartment listings and
  checks messages from potential roommates.

<br />
Our 2 user flows for new and returning users shows the different screens they visit
and the decisions they make as they complete their goals within the app. This informs
our product layout, ensuring that step of a user’s session is efficient and purposeful.

## Designing a mid-fidelity prototype

Drawing from insights gathered through competitive analysis and user research, we began creating wireframes for Room. To streamline the design process, we divided the responsibility among team members, assigning each person specific screens to lead.

<br />I focused on the designs of the Home and Profiles pages while my teammates
concentrated on the Sign In/Sign Up, Listings and Messages screens. These
initial designs served as a solid foundation as we continually iterated on them
through collaborative brainstorming and feedback sessions.

# Reflection and Learnings

Working on this project with a team of designers has been an exciting and valuable experience. I thoroughly enjoyed the collaboration and shared passion throughout the process. Here are my top 3 takeaways!

## 1. The best designs come from collaboration.

Each member brought their own unique perspectives and ideas, making our brainstorming sessions dynamic and inspiring. By bouncing ideas off each other, we often arrived at solutions and features we wouldn’t have came up with independently.

## 2. Coordinating team effort.

This experience taught my teammates and me how to work effectively as a cohesive design team. We split tasks such as competitive analysis, user research, and the creation of design artifacts among ourselves, ensuring that each member could focus on their strengths and interests. This approach allowed us to capitalize on individual strengths and created a collaborative environment where everyone was motivated and engaged to achieve our shared goals.

## 3. Enhancing communication skills.

Working in a team setting allowed me to practice articulating my ideas clearly during team presentations and design discussions. It also helped me develop my ability to give and receive constructive feedback. Active listening and mutual respect among team members fostered a supportive environment, enhancing both productivity and creativity.

<br />
<br />
Collaboration with other designers is something that I’ve found I really enjoy
and will aim to seek in future opportunities!
